	<p>There are also many interesting stationary displays where you can take your time and look come and get and up close look at what was used in early agriculture.</p>
		
	<p>There are several buildings and outdoor areas are stuffed with flea marketers.  The incredible variety of old and new items they bring to sell is almost overwhelming.  Allow some time to browse them all and bring home a treasure.</p>

	<h3>About the facility</h3>

	<p>The Pulaski County fairgrounds are located in Winamac Indiana on an amazingly scenic site surrounded on three sides by the Tippecanoe River. While it&rsquo;s right in the middle of town, you might not even realize it.</p>

	<h3>Brief overview of the days</h3>

	<p>The summer show officially runs from Thursday morning to Sunday midday. Wednesday is our main setup day, which is why we charge less for attendance. There will still be some things to see and do though in the afternoon.</p>

	<p>The show runs at full strength on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday with Saturday being our busiest day. Be prepared for a large crowd and lots of fun. Parking gets tight and we encourage carpooling.</p>

	<p>Our show runs until midday on Sunday and then we start to take down the displays and the vendors begin to pack up. To maximize your experience, please come early on Sunday if that&rsquo;s the day that you wish to attend.</p>

	<h3>Moving displays</h3>

	<p>One of the highlights of our show is being able to see so many pieces of equipment in action which we run throughout the day. We generally start on the north end with wheat threshing and then move across the drive to demonstrate various corn related items. Then at the south end of the area there is a full scale sawmill and all the related pieces to turn a full log into a finished board.</p>

	<p>Gather around and see just how it was done in the past. At the end of each demonstration you will have the chance to come up and take a closer look at the equipment and we encourage you to ask any questions you may have.</p>

	<p>Please be aware that most of this equipment can be very dangerous. We ask that you stay behind the barriers and do not approach the machinery until everything is powered down. Please keep a close eye on your kids too. We know they are excited to see what&rsquo;s going on but we want them to remain safe.</p>

	<h3>Stationary displays</h3>

	<p>We have rows and rows of tractors that range from lawn and garden tractors to full size. You will be able to see tractors that have been fully restored to ones that are in mostly original condition as well as common pieces that are well known to one of a kinds that our exhibitors have created or customized.</p>

	<p>We do have quite a few stationary hit and miss engines that when running are quite a sight and sound to enjoy.</p>

	<p>Most of the stationary displays are ones our exhibitors have brought in to display. The variety can vary from year to year. We always look forward to seeing what comes in. <a href="/info/exhibitor-information">Go to our exhibitor information page</a> to learn more.</p>

	<p>Look all you want, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all there for. We ask that you do not touch or sit on any of the displays without the owner or operator&#39;s permission. If the owner is onsite, please contact them if you would like to get a closer look or to ask them any questions.</p>

	<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to walk through the buildings and tents. There are many smaller display items inside that are very interesting to check out.</p>

	<h3>Blue shirts</h3>

	<p>You will notice many of our club members in blue shirts around the show. We are just as excited to be here as you are and our goal is make sure your experience a great one. If there is anything that you need do not hesitate to ask and we will make every effort to help you out.</p>

	<h3>What to bring</h3>

	<p>You won&rsquo;t need to bring very much to enjoy the show. Make sure you dress appropriately for the weather as it can get very hot in the middle of July. Stay well hydrated to avoid heat related issues.</p>

	<p>We do not have an ATM onsite yet so please bring cash. Most vendors at the show do not accept credit cards.</p>

	<h3>Food vendors</h3>

	<p>We have many food stands to suit almost every appetite. There are indoor and outdoor seating areas for you to sit down and enjoy a full meal or a tasty snack.</p>

	<h3>Flea market</h3>

	<p>The flea marketers never disappoint. There are so many great items available for sale. There are books, toys, new stuff, old stuff, pieces and parts, tools, complete running equipment, hand crafted items, and more. It&rsquo;s impossible to list it all.</p>

	<p>There are four buildings with flea marketers inside and a very large outdoor area with even more! Put a few extra bucks in your pocket. You won&rsquo;t want to miss out on the great finds.</p>

	<h3>Entertainment</h3>

	<p>We have some excellent entertainment for you this year. Please check out the daily tabs for the week of the show to see what each day will feature.</p>

	<h3>Kids games</h3>

	<p>Kids games are held Thursday through Saturday at 1:30 P.M. in Building 9.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<h3>Announcers stand</h3>

	<p>Special announcements and information regarding all of the days&rsquo; events will be relayed to you by our professional announcer Bob Smith. You can find him at Building 9 near the ham and beans.</p>

	<h3>Show merchandise</h3>

	<p>Come visit the show office in the north end of building 3. Not only is it the show headquarters for the week, it&rsquo;s the place to get some cool merchandise. We have hats, t-shirts, and reusable shopping bags with our name and logo printed on them for sale.</p>

	<p>You can also purchase buttons and plaques for this year as well as remaining ones from previous years.</p>

	<h3>Golf cart policy</h3>

	<p>Golf carts and utility vehicles are allowed.&nbsp; <span style="color:#e74c3c"><strong>Beginning 2020, we are charging $10 for golf carts and utility vehicles that will be operated on show grounds.</strong></span>&nbsp; Due to the size of our show, we ask that only people who need this type of transportation bring them.&nbsp; It is much easier to see more of the show by walking.&nbsp; All golf carts and utility vehicles must be insured by you prior to the show and then registered at our office.&nbsp; Please click the link below for more information.</p>

	<p><a href="/Info/GolfCartPolicy" target="_blank">Go to golf cart policy page </a></p>

	<h3>Other means of transportation</h3>

	<p>Bicycles, scooters, mopeds, and similar things are not permitted to be ridden around the show. You may arrive to the show however you wish but please park by the gate when you get here. Walking is the easiest way to enjoy our show.</p>

	<p>Battery powered personal mobility scooters, wheel chairs, and other medically required mobility devices are no problem as we make every effort to keep our show accessible to everybody.</p>

	<h3>Restroom facilities</h3>

	<p>We have port-a-potties placed throughout the show grounds. There are handicap accessible ones available. A few locations also have portable handwashing stations.</p>

	<p>Permanent restroom facilities are located near the show office in Building 10.</p>

	<h3>Internet access</h3>

	<p>We expect to have free Wi-Fi this year. The hot spot is located near the community building. The signal will not reach the majority grounds, so if you wish to connect then grab your device and relax at a nearby bench.</p>

	<h3>Trash and recycling</h3>

	<p>We have 55 gallon drums lined with bags placed all over the show grounds for trash. Trash is picked up around 8:00 A.M. every morning by our own club members with help from other volunteers.</p>

	<p>If you see a recycling container, please place your empty aluminum cans and glass or plastic bottles in it. The local Boy Scout troop helps us out and collects all the recyclables during the show.</p>

	<h3>Pet policy</h3>

	<p>Well behaved dogs are allowed. Your dog must be kept on a leash and supervised by a responsible person. Please clean up after you pet. Nobody likes stepping in dog bombs.</p>

	<h3>Security and safety</h3>

	<p>The Club takes reasonable precautions for safety of all exhibits, but will not be responsible for vandalism, theft, or destruction by other means.</p>

	<p>We have the Pulaski Co. REACT team that provides onsite security during the day. They are stationed near the community building. The local police department patrols the grounds during nighttime hours. An ambulance with two EMTs is also onsite during the day.</p>

	<p>If you have any medical, safety, or security concerns please immediately tell a blue shirt member of the club. We carry radios and can contact any resources that are needed.</p>

	<p>It is not uncommon to have one or two personal medical related issues occur every year. Our club has a safety plan in place and takes helping our exhibitors, vendors, and visitors very seriously.</p>

	<p>Remember to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.</p>

	<h3>Alcohol policy</h3>

	<p>Local town laws prohibit the consumption of alcohol on the show grounds.</p>
